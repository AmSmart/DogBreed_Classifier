DogBreed_Classifier
This is the model made in Pytorch and it classifies between different breed of Dogs.

This Project was given to my by Udacity and It was a real fun solving it. Although, it took days to figure it out. It was great. 

This model shows the different breeds of dogs. Upon showing it a Human, it will describe it as Human else it will describe and show the 
Breed of Dog.

The model was first made by me which have 13% accuracy, It was built on VGG16 which was trained on thousands on images.
In next turn, We use Transfer learning, which then helps us in getting 64 % accuracy. This time we use the Resnet model.
